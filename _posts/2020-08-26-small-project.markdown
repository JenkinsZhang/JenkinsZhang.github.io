## Foreword
>  It has been a long time since I built this blog, but I barely wrote anything on it. I will try my best to learn and post something that I think is of some value to my blog in the future time.



## Introduction
>  My personal project has online! Check out at [MyProject](http://34.105.212.23/).
>
>> It uses SpringBoot & SpringCloud as backend frameworks and Vue.js as frontend framework.
>
>> I deploy it using Docker & Nginx on my personal Google Cloud Server.(I got free $270 for being a new user!).

Here's what the website looks like:

![demo-website](/img/in-post/2020-08-26/website.png)

You can go to [website-admin](http://34.105.212.23/admin) to check out the admin panel and modify courses. 
The account has been created for you, the login name is 'Test' and the password is '1234'.
> You can't use google or facebook or twitter to sign in because I haven't added this function. 
> It's a little bit complex for me right now and the page is just a template. You can just login with the account I provide you.

I use "ace" template to create the admin website.

Here's Course Management in admin panel.

## Todo
<b>So many things to be done!</b><br>
> As you can see, although it took me a lot of time to build this(Even if it's just a course that I found on the website. And there are videos that teach me about it), there are many functions that aren't realized.
> 1. SMS Code
> 2. Course Payment
> 3. Video uploading (It's too slow right now)
> 4. Sign in through third party  

**I don't know if I have the ability or the time to finish the Todo list. I'll try my best.**

**Now I want to focus on my upcoming postgraduate studies at UCD. Bye for now!**
